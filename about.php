                I am an aspiring web developer from Gothenburg, Sweden. I am currently studying at YRGO Higher Vocational Education, in the first semester of a two year program.
                
                This is my first ever coding project, and i don't have any precious coding or programming experience. I chose this education because I wanted to broaden my horizon, and have always been interested in everyting techy. Therefore the endless posibillity of programming seems like a perfect way for me to prosper, where one day maybe I'll make websites for my favorite Game Developers! 
                
                Aside from my studies I enjoy video games, art and horror/mystery (movies, books, truecrime etc.). I am a real sucker for wine, derpy dogs and Radiohead.
