#Some Teams

###Welcome to my adaptation of the Some Teams assignment. This is the first PHP assignment for the Web Developer class of 2025 (WU25).


##About
This project consists of a small website that provides information about the UEFA Women's Champions League teams participating in the League Phase of the tournament. There are options to view more information about each team and their opponents. There is also a page about the creator.

##How Its Made
The website is built using PHP, with PHP, HTML, and CSS working together. The site consists of the following pages:
-index.php = Start page with a list of all the teams.
-about.php = about the creator, contacts
-info.php = information about every team.

##About The Creator
My name is Benita Almroth. I am currently a student in the Web Developer program at YRGO Higher Vocational Education in Gothenburg.
